              Telegraph tokens only come into existence as a result of a
              validated transaction, with each node being able to claim a share
              of all minted tokens.
            </p>
            <p>
              This equates to a fair and accountable means of distributing the
              tokens across participants within the Telegraph Ecosystem, while
              removing speculation as a driving factor.
